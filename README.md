# librarybytegeist
The Library Bytegeist podcast

About

This podcast is a collection of audio stories from the libraries, archives, and museums of New York City. It is brought to you by the Metropolitan New York Library Council, where the libraries and archives of New York comes together to learn, share ideas, and collaborate.

Library Bytegeist was formerly hosted on Soundcloud. We have now migrated to a self-hosting option based on instructions from the Mellon-grant funded project Preserve This Podcast. The instructions for the site build and for podcast hosting will be updated on preservethispodcast.org
